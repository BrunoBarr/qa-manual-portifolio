# Manual QA Testing Portfolio

This repository contains my Manual QA Testing Portfolio, created as part of my career transition into Quality Assurance.  
It demonstrates structured manual testing practices, clear documentation, and a strong problem-solving mindset built from a technical industrial background.

## Project Overview

This portfolio showcases my skills in:

- Manual Software Testing  
- Test Case Design  
- Test Documentation  
- Exploratory Testing  
- Bug Reporting  
- QA Best Practices  

The repository includes multiple systems under test, commonly used in QA practice, to demonstrate versatility and real-world testing scenarios.

## Systems Under Test

### 1. SauceDemo
- **URL:** https://www.saucedemo.com  
- **Type:** Web application (E-commerce)  
- **Purpose:** Functional testing of a complete purchase flow  

### 2. DemoQA – Automation Practice Form
- **URL:** https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form  
- **Type:** Web application (Form-based)  
- **Purpose:** Form validation and input testing  

### 3. JSONPlaceholder API
- **URL:** https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com  
- **Type:** Public REST API (Fake API)  
- **Purpose:** Manual API testing using CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)  

## Test Objectives

- Validate core application functionalities  
- Verify form validation rules and user input handling  
- Identify functional and usability issues  
- Apply structured manual QA methodologies  
- Demonstrate professional QA documentation standards  

## Test Scope

### In Scope

**SauceDemo**
- Login and authentication  
- Product listing and sorting  
- Shopping cart functionality  
- Checkout process  

**DemoQA (Forms)**
- Required fields validation  
- Invalid input handling (email, phone number)  
- Boundary testing  
- File upload validation  
- Successful form submission  

**JSONPlaceholder API**
- CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Positive and negative API scenarios
- Status code validation
- Response body validation

### Out of Scope

- Performance testing  
- Security testing  
- Load and stress testing  
- Mobile responsiveness  

## Test Types Performed

- Functional Testing  
- Smoke Testing  
- Exploratory Testing  
- Regression Testing (basic)  
- Boundary Value Testing 
- Manual API Testing 

## Test Documentation Structure
``` 
manual/
├── test-cases        → Detailed manual test cases
├── docs              → Test scope, scenarios, system overview
└── bug-reports        → Documented defects and observations
```

### Documentation Includes

- Test Scenarios  
- Detailed Test Cases (steps and expected results)  
- Exploratory Testing Notes  
- Bug Reports with severity and priority  

## Defect Reporting

Defects are documented using a structured format, including:

- Clear reproduction steps  
- Expected vs. actual results  
- Severity and priority  
- Environment information  
- Notes and observations  

Some demo systems may intentionally contain limited or inconsistent validations; these behaviors are documented as QA observations.

## Tools Used

- Web Browser (Chromium-based)  
- Postman (Manual API Testing)  
- Git & GitHub  
- Markdown  
- Visual Studio Code

## Continuous Improvement

This portfolio will continue to evolve with:

- Additional manual test cases  
- Expanded bug reports  
- New systems under test  
- Advanced API testing and validation
- Future transition to test automation using Python

## Final Note

This repository reflects my hands-on approach to Quality Assurance, emphasizing practical manual testing, structured test documentation, and analytical thinking. It showcases how I design test cases, explore system behavior, and document results following professional QA practices.
