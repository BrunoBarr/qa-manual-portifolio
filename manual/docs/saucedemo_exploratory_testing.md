# Exploratory Testing – SauceDemo

## Session Objective
Identify defects and unexpected behaviors not covered by predefined test cases.

## Approach
The application was tested without predefined scripts, focusing on realistic user behavior, edge cases, and navigation flow.

## Areas Explored
- Rapid login attempts using different user credentials
- Navigation between pages during checkout
- Adding and removing multiple items from the shopping cart
- Page refresh behavior during checkout flow

## Observations
- Error messages are clearly displayed for invalid login attempts
- Navigation remains consistent during the checkout process
- No critical issues were identified during exploratory testing

## Risks & Limitations
- Limited number of test users available
- Test data is static and predefined

## Conclusion
Exploratory testing validated overall application stability and supported confidence in the checkout flow under common user interactions.
