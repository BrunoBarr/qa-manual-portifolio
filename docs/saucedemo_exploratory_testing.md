# Exploratory Testing – SauceDemo

## Objective
Perform exploratory testing to identify defects that may not be covered by predefined test cases.

## Approach
The application was tested without predefined scripts, focusing on user behavior, edge cases, and unexpected interactions.

## Areas Explored
- Rapid login attempts with different users
- Navigation between pages during checkout
- Adding and removing multiple items from the cart
- Page refresh behavior during checkout flow

## Observations
- Error messages are clearly displayed for invalid login attempts
- Navigation remains consistent during the checkout process
- No critical issues were found during exploratory testing

## Conclusion
Exploratory testing helped validate overall application stability and identify potential edge cases for future test cycles.
